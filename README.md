 Common Components such as Modals, buttons, lists etc...


After cloning, in the root directory execute 'npm i'.

Inside each component there are two files:
1. autoprefixer.bat
2. sass batch.bat

These batch files prompt for input of the folder to operate on.

autoprefixer generates a browser portable index.css...

"sass batch" watches for changes to any SCSS files and updates the CSS...

Open the index.html of the component you want to run...
